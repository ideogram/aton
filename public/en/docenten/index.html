  <h1>Main Teachers</h1>
  <p><strong>Arie Jan Hoorweg</strong> is founder and director of Alexander Techniek Opleiding
Nederland</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I followed the 3 year training-course in London from 1975 untill 1977 inclusive
with Walter* and Dilys Carrington. After my training I was teaching privately
for 9 years when I started in January 1987 the training-course for
teachers-to-be in Holland. Besides my work as a teacher-trainer on ATON, I teach
yearly on different training-courses in South-America. Further along do I teach
privately (at my home) in Amstelveen, Alkmaar and Utrecht. In Alkmaar do I work
with a psychologist, mostly with people with burn-out. In Utrecht we form with 4
colleagues the Utrechts Alexander Techniek Instituut voor Musici (UATIM), where
we teach the Alexander Technique to many students of the Conservatorium. The
A.T. is included in the curriculum of the Utrechts Conservatorium. Also do I
regularly give workshops and work on a project basis with dancers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>*Walter Carrington had his training with F.M. Alexander from 1936 till 1939. He assisted
Alexander till his death in 1955, after which he took charge of the
training-course and run it till his death in 2005.</p>

<p><strong>Anna Koolen</strong> is teaching at ATON, since July 1999.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I like helping people and organisations, finding back their compassion and
direction by teaching to stop with undirected power, or the discipline  of
effortless in practise. My method of work is based on the Alexander Technique.
Beside that I have a lot of experience with diverse psychology techniques, on
qualities, dealing with differences, empowerment, spiritual visions, meditation-
and visualisation techniques. My background: more than 25 years of experience as
an independent entrepreneur, among others in the roles of: policy advisor,
writer and project manager (at GGZ, Overheid and Zelfhulp), trainer personal and
/ or team coach. I teach the Alexander Technique since 1999 at my practise in
Rosmalen and on location.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Wilberd Bakker</strong> is teaching at ATON since 2000.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I studied math at the Free University in Amsterdam and singing at Sweelinck
Conservatorium. Besides teaching math, I sang for ten years in the Dutch Vocal
Ensemble and conducted several choirs. I teach the Alexander Technique at my
practise in Deventer. See also: <a href="http://www.eristijd.nl">www.eristijd.nl</a></p>
