<p>On this site you will find information on <a href="#opleiding">training to become a teacher of the Alexander Technique</a>, at the
<strong>Alexander Techniek Opleiding Nederland (ATON)</strong> training course, situated in a suburb of Amsterdam called Amstelveen.</p>


    </section>

  
    <section id="opleiding">
      <h1>Teachers Training</h1>
      

<p>The objective of the training-course is first and formost the training of people
wishing to become a teacher of the Alexander Technique. At the same time it is
possible for people, who have lessons, to visit the course in order to deepen
into the Technique, say for some days or any other length of time, without
wanting to become a teacher. ATON offers also regularly, get togethers.</p>

<h2 id="the-process">The Process</h2>

<p>First: The training program enables the student to teach in an
independent, trustful, explorative and open manner of teaching. Second: Through
working on yourself, both on the training-course and outside it, you will
discover more and more about the principles of the Alexander Technique.</p>

<h2 id="impact">Impact</h2>

<p>During the three years of training you will be busy physically as well as
mentally and emotionally as well as spiritually. You will notice smaller or
bigger changes on one or more of these levels. All through this intensive
process of change you need an environment of security and support in order to
come closer to yourself and be able to remain with the principles of the
Alexander Technique. You can count on personal attention for your process.</p>

<h2 id="group-size">Group size</h2>

<p>Personal attention is very essential to instruct the Alexander
Technique well. That is why ATON chooses for a small number of students. The
group of students (first-, second- and thirdyears together) consist of no more
then twelve students.
<img src="/pyramide1.jpg" alt="Game met een menselijke pyramide, in opbouw" /></p>

<h2 id="the-teachers-team">The Teachers Team</h2>

<p>The teacher-student ratio is maximal 1 to 5. The teacher team
consist of three senior teachers. Our team is supplemented by teachers of our
network and newly-qualified students. Regularly teachers from abroad and from
here, with a specialisation, will be invited.</p>

<h2 id="alexander-technique-developments-in-practise">Alexander Technique developments in practise</h2>

<p>ATON closely follows the developments in the field of the Alexander Technique
through taking part in rural and international meetings. The teachers work on
deepening and exchange of experience in teaching, between themselves regularly
and besides that with newly qualified teachers and other colleagues. ATON keeps
in touch with the application of the Alexander Technique in practise.</p>

<h2 id="about-alexander-techniek-opleiding-nederland">About Alexander Techniek Opleiding Nederland</h2>

<p>Alexander Techniek Opleiding Nederland (ATON) was founded in 1987 after approval
by the English professional society: <a href="http://www.stat.org.uk/">The Society of Teachers of the Alexander
Technique (STAT)</a>. Since 2003 ATON is under the jurisdiction of the Dutch Society
of <a href="http://www.nevlat.nl/">Alexander Techniek Leraren(NeVLAT)</a>. See for more information www.nevlat.nl.</p>

<p>The Dutch Society maintains contact with other sister-societies in the world
about the standards of quality on teacher training-courses. In particular the
English Society stood at the basis of setting the standards of the training
policies. The policies developed by the STAT are taken over by the international
sister-societies.</p>

    <section id="toelating-opzet-kosten">
      <h1>Admission, Design and Costs</h1>
      

<p>Are you motivated to follow the training to become an Alexander Technique
teacher and to use it for your personal development? Are you at least 21 years
old and have at least 15 lessons experience recently with the Technique? If so,
we like to get to know you better.</p>

<h2 id="admission-to-the-training">Admission to the training</h2>

<p>At first we will invite you to come and taste for 3
or 4 days, the training-course, then the admission procedure consist of a
personal talk, some private lessons and the filling in of a questionnaire.
After that we discuss together with you whether ATON indeed is the right place
for you. If so, we will ask you to sign an agreement.</p>

<h2 id="multilingual-education">Multilingual Education</h2>

<p>Partly because of international guest teachers, and partly because of english
books and articles and the fact that we train also foreign students, both
english and dutch are spoken.</p>

<h2 id="content-of-the-training-course">Content of the Training-course</h2>

<p>The training lasts at least three years, each 35 weeks, with 4 mornings a week
of 3.5 hrs. per day, but with a total of at least 1600 hours and consists of 80%
practical Alexander-work and 20% theory. This intensity and continuity heightens
the deepening and effectiveness of the Technique.</p>

<p>The <em>first year</em> is in the light of learning to think, react and function from the
Alexander Technique principles point of view, the Use of the Self. Before you
learn to work on other people you will profound/ learn about the basis of the
Technique.</p>

<p>The <em>second year</em> you will refine both your own development as well as
the manual skills and the physical procedures of the Technique.</p>

<p>The <em>third year</em> you will integrate what you learned in the first and second year
up to working independently first on fellow students and then on others.</p>

<h2 id="daily-program">Daily Program</h2>

<p>The daily returning program are directed to the basic skills of
the Technique:
- An individual lesson of 15 or 30 minutes
- Exploring - together what happens when moving
- Learning about the use of the hands
- Self-activity and at a later stage working on others
- Studying Alexander’s books and related articles</p>

<p>Additions to the daily program are, amongst others:</p>

<ul>
<li>Anatomy and physiology from an Alexander Technique point of view</li>
<li>Voicework</li>
<li>Starting and organizing your own practice</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="moderation">Moderation</h2>

<p>In their 6th and 9th term students will get a visit by a moderator.
This is a teacher from outside the school with many years of experience in
teaching. With an independent point of view, the moderator gives the student
important feedback in their personal development in the Technique and as a
teacher to be.</p>

<p>Costs The costs are € 7.500,- per year. It is possible to pay per term at €
2.500,- .</p>

<p>Right of changes reserved.</p>

<p>ATON is registered by the Centraal Register Kort Beroepsonderrwijs (CRKBO).
Because of this registration the training-course is exempted of being liable
to pay value added tax (VAT). (see <a href="www.crkbo.nl">www.crkbo.nl</a>.)</p>

      <h1>Main Teachers</h1>
      <p><strong>Arie Jan Hoorweg</strong> is founder and director of Alexander Techniek Opleiding
Nederland</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I followed the 3 year training-course in London from 1975 untill 1977 inclusive
with Walter* and Dilys Carrington. After my training I was teaching privately
for 9 years when I started in January 1987 the training-course for
teachers-to-be in Holland. Besides my work as a teacher-trainer on ATON, I teach
yearly on different training-courses in South-America. Further along do I teach
privately (at my home) in Amstelveen, Alkmaar and Utrecht. In Alkmaar do I work
with a psychologist, mostly with people with burn-out. In Utrecht we form with 4
colleagues the Utrechts Alexander Techniek Instituut voor Musici (UATIM), where
we teach the Alexander Technique to many students of the Conservatorium. The
A.T. is included in the curriculum of the Utrechts Conservatorium. Also do I
regularly give workshops and work on a project basis with dancers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>*Walter Carrington had his training with F.M. Alexander from 1936 till 1939. He assisted
Alexander till his death in 1955, after which he took charge of the
training-course and run it till his death in 2005.</p>

<p><strong>Anna Koolen</strong> is teaching at ATON, since July 1999.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I like helping people and organisations, finding back their compassion and
direction by teaching to stop with undirected power, or the discipline  of
effortless in practise. My method of work is based on the Alexander Technique.
Beside that I have a lot of experience with diverse psychology techniques, on
qualities, dealing with differences, empowerment, spiritual visions, meditation-
and visualisation techniques. My background: more than 25 years of experience as
an independent entrepreneur, among others in the roles of: policy advisor,
writer and project manager (at GGZ, Overheid and Zelfhulp), trainer personal and
/ or team coach. I teach the Alexander Technique since 1999 at my practise in
Rosmalen and on location.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Wilberd Bakker</strong> is teaching at ATON since 2000.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I studied math at the Free University in Amsterdam and singing at Sweelinck
Conservatorium. Besides teaching math, I sang for ten years in the Dutch Vocal
Ensemble and conducted several choirs. I teach the Alexander Technique at my
practise in Deventer. See also: <a href="http://www.eristijd.nl">www.eristijd.nl</a></p>

      <h1>About the Alexander Technique</h1>
      <blockquote>
<p>One has to make a change in the manner of use to raise the standerd of general functioning.
    <strong>— F.M. Alexander (1869-1955)</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src="/fm.jpg" alt="F. M. Alexander" /></p>

<p>De Alexander Technique owes its name to its founder, the Australian F.M.
Alexander. He worked as a recital artist until he was no longer able to do his
job due to voice problems. No doctor was able to familiarize him with this
problem, other than taking a rest, which did not help. As a result, he started
investigating what was wrong and what he himself could do to remedy it, and so
came to his findings empirically. This led to his psycho-physical re-educational
method.</p>

<p>Alexander started teaching his technique in the nineties of the 19th century.
Thanks to the generation that has worked with him, his experience and knowledge
have been passed on to us and greatly enriched in the last century. In the
Netherlands, the method is mainly known to musicians, stage artists, etc. At the
scientific level, the Dutch Nobel Prize winner Nicolaas Tinbergen devoted a good
part of his speech to the acceptance of the Nobel Prize in Physiology and
Medicine.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Alexander had found a method applicable to most common problems of daily
  life: the problem of habitual misuse of the self, of thoughtlessness.
  <strong>— Walter Carrington MSI 1996</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="from-a-lost-reduced-psycho-physical-balance-to-effortless-movement">From a lost/reduced psycho-physical balance to effortless movement</h2>

<p>We often get so caught up by the fast and busy lives that we hardly spend any
more time on ourselves. This leads to that we become aware (too)late when our
bodies literally suffers from stress and/or overload. Small kids react and move
efficiently in a natural and light way. In the course of years the efficient and
light working coordination between the cooperating (balance)mechanisms (read:
think, want and feel) become unbalanced and with that the musculoskeletal system
loses its subtle working, and with that, has to do more to keep us upright, in
one way or the other. The seemingly effortlessness of moving in small children
slowly declines and changes unnoticed into a stiffer way of moving, which can
clearly be seen in adults. We will not get this coordination, with its
associated subtle muscle activities or control back, by simply doing more
exercises or trying harder. As that is, reinforcing the present or habitual way
of reacting in processes like thinking, willing and feeling (the use of
ourselves), these have gotten us into problems in the first place. That means at
a basic level nothing has changed, only at a superficial level.</p>

<p>Alexander discovered that our (automatic) reactions are the key to let the
subtle cooperating mechanisms work uninterfered with. When we do not try to do
our best, our reactions to impulses (from within and outside us) will get the
space to work more efficient. Support of the body and movement will happen
seemingly effortless. Through the technique Alexander developed, our body will
get back the original possibilities of the subtle cooperating (balance)
mechanisms.</p>

<h2 id="what-do-you-learn">What do you learn?</h2>

<p>Alexander Technique lessons are based on simple, but thorough principles. You
will work on conscious coordination in action. The teacher teaches you to stop
with immediate, irrelevant and often u Unconscious physical and mental
reactions, which will give you time and space for conscious direction of your
body, brain or yourself.</p>

<p>The Technique teaches you to gain conscious and constructive controle over the
use of yourself. You learn to tackle the causes of complaints in a new way. You
do not fixate on the complaint, but you direct your attention on unlearning
irrelevant responses or inefficient use of your muscles, in different
situations. De hands of the teacher are an important aspect in letting you
clearly experience, that by creating mental space, you subsequently, can choose
to prevent the current, often fixed (movement)patterns, to come about. Verbal
instructions help too in this process.</p>

<h2 id="what-outcome-can-you-expect">What outcome can you expect?</h2>

<p>Some positive results; prevention of unnecessary and unjust reactions, through
which you will get more freedom of choice in how you like to be with an
appropriate and more efficient use of your muscles, in different situations.</p>

<p>After a number of lessons pupils experience themselves as more quiet and
restful, in more exciting or tense moments too. Also they may hear often that
they have grown, become taller. Figurative, as the Alexander Technique brings
about a change in how you stand in life. Literally, as the Alexander Technique
prevents or solves unnecessary shortening of the muscles. Most people value the
Technique because one can take one’s own responsibility for one’s own well
being, actively.</p>

<h2 id="for-whom-is-the-alexander-technique">For whom is the Alexander Technique?</h2>

<p>The Alexander Technique is for everybody who is interested in reacting and
moving more efficiently. For people who have neck-, back- and shoulder
complaints or other complaints, which are caused by wrong habits or stress.</p>

<p>People who have to make partial or subtle movements, either in their daily
activities or by profession, like musicians. Find in the Alexander Technique a
good relief or support. Musicians, dancers and actors experience even more
perfection in their reaction and movement patterns through the Technique, which
by practising harder and more not would have accomplished.</p>

<p>Similarly, people with physically demanding professions, achieve less physical
complaints with less and with better controlled muscle strength.</p>

<p>For people with psychological complaints, the Technique will bring possibly more
psychological rest. (We do not claim to work as psychologists).</p>

<h2 id="lessons-in-the-alexander-technique">Lessons in the Alexander Technique.</h2>

<p>Lessons in the Technique are most beneficial on an individual basis. You learn
the Technique through the hands of the teacher in combination with verbal
instructions. At first you achieve result through undergo and experience the
Technique. Repetition is necessary in order to break habitual patterns. As you
go along you will notice that the principals of the Technique will come home to
you in your daily activities.</p>

<p>Mostly after a demonstration lesson or a few lessons, you will notice the
difference. For a longer lasting and more established effect you need a series
of 20 to 50 lessons. After this series of lessons you will be able to apply the
principles of the Alexander Technique in your daily life. After that, as
required, you can take the od lesson to remain conscious of the principles.</p>

<h2 id="what-does-it-cost">What does it cost?</h2>

<p>A lesson cost anything between € 35,- and € 60,- (incl. vat), depending on length of time and experience of the teacher.
