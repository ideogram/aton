  <h1>Teachers Training</h1>
  

<p>The objective of the training-course is first and formost the training of people
wishing to become a teacher of the Alexander Technique. At the same time it is
possible for people, who have lessons, to visit the course in order to deepen
into the Technique, say for some days or any other length of time, without
wanting to become a teacher. ATON offers also regularly, get togethers.</p>

<h2 id="the-process">The Process</h2>

<p>First: The training program enables the student to teach in an
independent, trustful, explorative and open manner of teaching. Second: Through
working on yourself, both on the training-course and outside it, you will
discover more and more about the principles of the Alexander Technique.</p>

<h2 id="impact">Impact</h2>

<p>During the three years of training you will be busy physically as well as
mentally and emotionally as well as spiritually. You will notice smaller or
bigger changes on one or more of these levels. All through this intensive
process of change you need an environment of security and support in order to
come closer to yourself and be able to remain with the principles of the
Alexander Technique. You can count on personal attention for your process.</p>

<h2 id="group-size">Group size</h2>

<p>Personal attention is very essential to instruct the Alexander
Technique well. That is why ATON chooses for a small number of students. The
group of students (first-, second- and thirdyears together) consist of no more
then twelve students.

<h2 id="the-teachers-team">The Teachers Team</h2>

<p>The teacher-student ratio is maximal 1 to 5. The teacher team
consist of three senior teachers. Our team is supplemented by teachers of our
network and newly-qualified students. Regularly teachers from abroad and from
here, with a specialisation, will be invited.</p>

<h2 id="alexander-technique-developments-in-practise">Alexander Technique developments in practise</h2>

<p>ATON closely follows the developments in the field of the Alexander Technique
through taking part in rural and international meetings. The teachers work on
deepening and exchange of experience in teaching, between themselves regularly
and besides that with newly qualified teachers and other colleagues. ATON keeps
in touch with the application of the Alexander Technique in practise.</p>

<h2 id="about-alexander-techniek-opleiding-nederland">About Alexander Techniek Opleiding Nederland</h2>

<p>Alexander Techniek Opleiding Nederland (ATON) was founded in 1987 after approval
by the English professional society: <a href="http://www.stat.org.uk/">The Society of Teachers of the Alexander
Technique (STAT)</a>. Since 2003 ATON is under the jurisdiction of the Dutch Society
of <a href="http://www.nevlat.nl/">Alexander Techniek Leraren(NeVLAT)</a>. See for more information www.nevlat.nl.</p>

<p>The Dutch Society maintains contact with other sister-societies in the world
about the standards of quality on teacher training-courses. In particular the
English Society stood at the basis of setting the standards of the training
policies. The policies developed by the STAT are taken over by the international
sister-societies.</p>

<p>Any question so far? Do get in contact with us, we happily answer your
questions.</p>
