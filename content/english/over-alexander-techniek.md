    **â€” F.M. Alexander (1869-1955)**

De Alexander Technique owes its name to its founder, the Australian F.M.
Alexander. He worked as a recital artist until he was no longer able to do his
job due to voice problems. No doctor was able to familiarize him with this
problem, other than taking a rest, which did not help. As a result, he started
investigating what was wrong and what he himself could do to remedy it, and so
came to his findings empirically. This led to his psycho-physical re-educational
method.

Alexander started teaching his technique in the nineties of the 19th century.
Thanks to the generation that has worked with him, his experience and knowledge
have been passed on to us and greatly enriched in the last century. In the
Netherlands, the method is mainly known to musicians, stage artists, etc. At the
scientific level, the Dutch Nobel Prize winner Nicolaas Tinbergen devoted a good
part of his speech to the acceptance of the Nobel Prize in Physiology and
Medicine.
