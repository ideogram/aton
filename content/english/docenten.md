> I followed the 3 year training-course in London from 1975 untill 1977 inclusive
> with Walter* and Dilys Carrington. After my training I was teaching privately

> teachers-to-be in Holland. Besides my work as a teacher-trainer on ATON, I teach
> yearly on different training-courses in South-America. Further along do I teach
> privately (at my home) in Amstelveen, Alkmaar and Utrecht. In Alkmaar do I work
> with a psychologist, mostly with people with burn-out. In Utrecht we form with 4
> colleagues the Utrechts Alexander Techniek Instituut voor Musici (UATIM), where
> we teach the Alexander Technique to many students of the Conservatorium. The
> A.T. is included in the curriculum of the Utrechts Conservatorium. Also do I
> regularly give workshops and work on a project basis with dancers.
