Are you motivated to follow the training to become an Alexander Technique
teacher and to use it for your personal development? Are you at least 21 years
old and have at least 15 lessons experience recently with the Technique? If so,
we like to get to know you better.

## Admission to the training 
At first we will invite you to come and taste for 3
or 4 days, the training-course, then the admission procedure consist of a
personal talk, some private lessons and the filling in of a questionnaire.
After that we discuss together with you whether ATON indeed is the right place
for you. If so, we will ask you to sign an agreement.

## Multilingual Education 
Partly because of international guest teachers, and partly because of english
books and articles and the fact that we train also foreign students, both
english and dutch are spoken.

## Content of the Training-course
The training lasts at least three years, each 35 weeks, with 4 mornings a week
of 3.5 hrs. per day, but with a total of at least 1600 hours and consists of 80%
practical Alexander-work and 20% theory. This intensity and continuity heightens
the deepening and effectiveness of the Technique.

The _first year_ is in the light of learning to think, react and function from the
Alexander Technique principles point of view, the Use of the Self. Before you
learn to work on other people you will profound/ learn about the basis of the
Technique. 

The _second year_ you will refine both your own development as well as
the manual skills and the physical procedures of the Technique.

The _third year_ you will integrate what you learned in the first and second year
up to working independently first on fellow students and then on others.

## Daily Program 
The daily returning program are directed to the basic skills of
the Technique: 
- An individual lesson of 15 or 30 minutes 
- Exploring - together what happens when moving 
- Learning about the use of the hands
- Self-activity and at a later stage working on others 
- Studying Alexander’s books and related articles

Additions to the daily program are, amongst others:

- Anatomy and physiology from an Alexander Technique point of view
- Voicework 
- Starting and organizing your own practice

## Moderation 
In their 6th and 9th term students will get a visit by a moderator.
This is a teacher from outside the school with many years of experience in
teaching. With an independent point of view, the moderator gives the student
important feedback in their personal development in the Technique and as a
teacher to be.

Costs The costs are € 7.500,- per year. It is possible to pay per term at €
2.500,- .
